notes:

- need to adjust text size and border for footnotes
(see https://derekkedziora.com/blog/paper-of-record)

- need 1st level of unnumbered lists to have dot points slightly further to the left
(maybe use text-align: match-parent)
(see https://derekkedziora.com/blog/snow-crash)

- second level of unnumbered lists
(see https://derekkedziora.com/blog/digital-tidying-the-links)

- same with numbered lists
(see https://derekkedziora.com/blog/western-consensus-thinking)

- maybe make aside class 
(see https://derekkedziora.com/blog/corona-western-consensus-thinking)

- quotes should have slightly different font size
(see https://derekkedziora.com/blog/imperialism-of-chomsky)
