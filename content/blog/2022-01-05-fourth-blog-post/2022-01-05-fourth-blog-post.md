A style guide for this blog.

## Headings

# H1

H1 will automatically be used for the page title. You probably won't be using
it in the body text at all.

## H2

H2 will be the main heading you will use. That and some sparing use of H3 will
be all you need. I would avoid the use of H4 and below.

### H3

This is a block of text that goes after headings. It spans two lines and is quite 
useful for playing around with paragraph spacing and margins.

#### H4

This is a block of text that goes after headings. It spans two lines and is quite 
useful for playing around with paragraph spacing and margins.

##### H5

This is a block of text that goes after headings. It spans two lines and is quite 
useful for playing around with paragraph spacing and margins.

###### H6

This is a block of text that goes after headings. It spans two lines and is quite 
useful for playing around with paragraph spacing and margins.

## Blockquotes

The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a `footer` or `cite` element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.

> This is a blockquote without attribution.
> **Note** that you can use *Markdown syntax* within a blockquote.

Text to break up the quotes.

> This is a blockquote with attribution! Don't communicate by sharing memory, 
> share memory by communicating.<br>
> â€” <cite>Rob Pike[^1]</cite>

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but Hugo supports them out-of-the-box.

   Name | Age
--------|------
    Bob | 27
  Alice | 23

As with quotes you can use inline Markdown within tables.

| Italics   | Bold     | Code   |
| --------  | -------- | ------ |
| *italics* | **bold** | `code` |
